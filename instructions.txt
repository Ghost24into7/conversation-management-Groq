Assignment: Conversation Management & Classification using Groq API

Objective
Implement two core tasks using Groq APIs (with OpenAI SDK compatibility). This assignment will test your ability to manage conversational data, perform summarization, and classify user chats with structured extraction — without using frameworks.

You must submit your work in Google Colab and also upload the notebook to GitHub for version tracking and evaluation.

Task 1: Managing Conversation History with Summarization
1. Maintain a running conversation history of user–assistant chats.
2. Implement summarization of conversation history to keep it concise.
3. Allow customization options for truncation:
a. Limit by number of conversation turns (e.g., last n messages).
b. Limit by character/word length.

4. Add periodic summarization:
a. Perform summarization after every k-th run of the conversation.
b. Store/replace the summarized version in the conversation history.

5. Demonstrate the functionality by:
a. Feeding multiple conversation samples.
b. Showing outputs at different truncation settings.
c. Showing how summarization happens after every k-th run (e.g., after every 3rd run).

Task 2: JSON Schema Classification & Information Extraction

1. Create a JSON schema to extract 5 details from chats related to information collection (e.g., name, email, phone, location, age).

2. Use OpenAI function calling with Groq API for structured outputs.

3. Demonstrate:
a. Parsing of at least 3 sample chats.
b. Validation of outputs against the schema.

Reference guides:
OpenAI Function Calling: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling
Groq API with OpenAI Client: https://console.groq.com/docs/openai

Requirements
1. Strictly no frameworks allowed — only standard Python + requests/openai client.
2. Use Groq API’s OpenAI-compatible SDK for function calling and completions.
3. Submission in Google Colab notebook with:
a. Clean, well-documented code.
b. Visible outputs for each task.
c. API keys included in the notebook for test runs.
4. Push the Colab notebook to GitHub and share the repository link.

Evaluation Criteria

1. Correctness of implementation. 
2. Proper use of summarization logic, including k-th run summarization.
3. Accuracy of JSON schema classification and extraction.
4. Clarity of code, documentation, and output presentation.
5. Proper GitHub versioning and clean repo structure.

You can update your submission later - if submitting partially.
